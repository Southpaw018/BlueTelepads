=============
 Use
=============
To use BlueTelepads, build two telepads. For both pads, you'll need:
  - 2 signs
  - 2 center blocks (lapis lazuli by default, where the plugin gets its name!)
  - 16 slabs (smooth stone by default)
  - 2 stone pressure plates
Once you have your materials together, build your two telepads:
  - Place the center block.
  - Place double slabs to the north, south, east, and west of the center block.
  - Place a sign underneath the center block. Make the third line of the sign the telepad's location name, if you want.
      For example, if you have a telepad on the roof of your house, and you set the third line to "My Roof," when you teleport there,
      BlueTelepads will tell you "Sending you to My Roof."
  - Place a stone pressure plate on top of the center block.
After you've built your telepads, tap (left click) the pressure plate of both telepads with redstone.

That's it!

Many thanks to both of them for their hard work on this plugin.
